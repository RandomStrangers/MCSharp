Another Test

1. We need to redefine two things, the player model, and the way logs are kept.

Steps Necessary:

Migrate player database into an actual database file, containing columns that are necessary for the players.

Tables would look like this:

Player {
		id
		UserName VarChar(16)
		Last Login DateTime
		Rank TinyInt?
}

PlayerSessions {
	id
	PlayerID
	BlocksCreated
	BlocksDeleted
	Date and time logged in
	Date and time logged out
}


2. Proper Logging Facilities

Quick fix is to add dates, and possibly have a new log at midnight each night.

Long term will be logging to a database of choice, defaulting to something like SQLite. Including Fields like:

LogEntry {
	id
	CategoryID
	Log Message
	Log DateTime
	LoggingEntity (Server, Player.name, or whereever the log came from)
}

Categories {
	id
	name
}


- Deletelvl needs to be able to delete unloaded levels
