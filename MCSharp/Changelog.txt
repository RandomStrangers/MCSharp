WHISPER / OPCHAT USAGE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/whisper										# Disables whisper mode

/whisper george									# All text is whispered to george

/whisper james (after using /whisper george)	# All text is whispered to james, not george

* Cannot whisper hidden admins / operators
* If user disconnects, must use /whisper to disable     (maybe they dced) 
* If already whispering someone and /whisper james....if james invalid, cancel all whispering
* If opchat is active, cannot use /whisper   (can still manually @whisper)
* If whisper is active, cannot use /opchat   (can still manually #opchat)


OPVIEW / LOCK / UNOPVIEW / UNLOCK USAGE
	All these commands follow the same general method for use.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
/opview									# allows you to select 2 points and all op_mats in that area turn pink, even air

/opview op_air op_red op_black			# allows you to select 2 blocks and all op_mats in that area turn pink, but not op_air, op_red, or op_black...up to 7 blocks can be ignored. can't type much more anyway

/opview all								# processes entire map, all blocks show up

/opview all op_air op_grass op_water	# processes entire map and ignores op_air, op_grass, op_water.

/opview air red black					# exactly the same as using /opview op_air op_red op_black, allows both types of logical thinking
